## Skins & Customization

To create new skins or edit existing ones, open the context menu (`right click or burger icon`) and select `Info & Customization`.
This will open up the `skins` folder, where you can edit existing `.png` files or create new ones.
Skin changes or new skins will appear immediately on the screen or the dropdown.

A skins consists of these four self-explanatory parts. The skin name is the name of the folder.
- `background.png`
- `mouse.png`
- `mouseArm.png`
- `keyboardArm.png`


This is how a skin looks like. The `.xcf` files can be edited with <LinkButton href="https://www.gimp.org/" newTab>GIMP</LinkButton>.

## Drag & Drop Layout

You can drag & drop images and animated GIFs directly in Streamdog and adjust their position, rotation and scale.
The layout tools and the window border will automatically disappear when Streamdog is not in focus.
The layout is saved automatically and restored on relaunch, separately for each skin. \
`Pro Tip:` you can copy a layout to another skin simply by copying `.layout.html` to its folder.
